    <h3>What You Need To Do Before & After Your Hijama Treatment</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>Here’s a practical and medically-informed guide on what you should do before and after your Hijama (cupping therapy) treatment to maximize the benefits and reduce risks.
    1. Fasting (2–3 Hours Before)
    Avoid heavy meals.
    Ideally, fast for 2–3 hours before the session.
    Drink plenty of water the day before and the day of your session.
    Avoid caffeinated and sugary drinks right before the session.
    2. Stay Hydrated
    Your body should not be in a full digestive state, but you should not be completely energy-deprived either.
    3. Shower or Bathe
    Take a shower before the session to ensure hygiene.
    Avoid using lotion or oils on the skin on the day of treatment, as it may affect cup suction.
    4. Avoid These Substances
    Caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, and heavy meats at least 12 hours before.
    These can impact circulation and detoxification.
    5. Rest and Be Calm
    Come in a relaxed state; don’t do strenuous activity right before.
    Light breathing or dhikr (remembrance) may help if you're nervous.
